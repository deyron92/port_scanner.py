# üìò Developer Notes

This project was created as part of a personal initiative to build practical and demonstrable Python tools focused on network automation and diagnostics. The goal was to develop a real-world utility that showcases proficiency with:

- Socket-based communication
- Command-line interface (CLI) tools
- Structured JSON data output
- Defensive coding practices

---

## üîç Project Motivation
As a Network Technician with an interest in automation and cybersecurity, I designed this scanner to:

- Practice low-level socket operations
- Demonstrate real-time port discovery
- Build a portfolio tool that represents real-world scenarios

---

## üß† Learning and Development Sources
The development process was supported by hands-on research, industry best practices, and personal experimentation with:

- Python 3.7+ standard library documentation
- Networking protocol guides (TCP/IP)
- Common port scanning methods used in tools like Nmap
- GitHub community repositories for structural inspiration

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Customization Notes
This tool is structured for easy modification and integration:

- Add multi-threading with `threading` or `concurrent.futures`
- Enhance with UDP or ICMP scanning
- Add export support to `.csv` or `.html`
- Wrap into a GUI or REST API

---

## üßæ Final Note
All code and documentation were written, structured, and tested by Deyron as part of a practical learning and portfolio development process.
